					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Beatboxing is a form of vocal percussion primarily involving the art of mimicking drum machines, using one's mouth, lips, tongue, and voice. It may also involve vocal imitation of turntablism, and other musical instruments. You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatboxing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
				<p>Beatbox originated in New York City in the 1980s as a way to mimic the sound of drums because at that time hip-hop was the hot shit and sometimes a rapper needed a beat when there was no sound system or such.</p>
				<p>Notable beatboxer Doug E. Fresh was one of the first people that started beatboxing, he even created called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Di_Da_Di" target="_blank">"La Di Da Di"</a> a song with MC Ricky D that had Doug beatbox the entire instrumental of it! You can listen to it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icBflcYZhpo&ab_channel=DeanyBoii" target="_blank">here</a>. Pretty Interesting ngl.</p>
				<p>Other notable old school beatboxers include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Kenny Muhammed</li>
					<li>Biz Markie</li>
					<li>The Fat Boys</li>
					<li>Red - Famous as the Homeless beatboxer from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWz-x7YMVCk&t=50s&ab_channel=HVW8Gallery" target="_blank">I Should Tell Your Momma On You</a></li>

				<h3>Ziad Swidan</h3>
				<div class="img-div">
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc32-D65STM&ab_channel=BeatboxInternational" target="blank"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dc32-D65STM/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Ziad Swidan in his Beatbox International Shoutout"></a>
				</div>
				<p>Now we can't talk about the Egyptian beatbox scene without talking about Ziad Swidan. He is one of <strong>THE</strong> best if not the best beatboxer in Egypt rn. Better than that he's the one that really put Egypt on the map beatbox-wise. He was recognized for his skill by D-Low and Puls8 and Colaps in <a href="https://youtu.be/Ja-lgh_cIeM?t=6760" target="_blank">this stream</a> by D-low and the lads when they were reacting to his "Drop Make Your Head Pop" GBB wildcard which was the first thing a shit ton of people saw from Ziad. Colaps and Puls8 even put him in their top 3 wildcards list!</p>
				<p>The oldest video I could find of Ziad was the one he posted on his channel on the <time datetime="2012-12-20">20th of December 2012</time>. though he has been beatboxing even before that but he kept working hard on his style and shit and even took a semi-break from 2018 to 2019 after almost quitting and became the beast that he is today.</p>
				
				<h3>Nanolotion</h3>
				<div class="img-div">
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC7ZbGP2Y4Q&ab_channel=Nanolotion" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cC7ZbGP2Y4Q/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Nanolotion in his SBXKB Wildcard"></a>
				</div>
				<p>Nanolotion formerly known as Se7s is also one of the top lads in Egypt. He's got a unique style of hard-hitting-bass-dubstep-EDM kind of style like the one you'd hear from the likes of Vocodah for example. They also have minimalism in common, as they both don't use a lot of sounds, but even though their sounds are limited they both have mastered their own sounds to the point of extreme control</p>
				<p>You might have seen him on the Beatbox Community discord server, or watched his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlaxle2f1K0&ab_channel=Nanolotion" target="_blank">GBB2021 Wildcard - Creature</a> which is the definition of sick, or seen his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC7ZbGP2Y4Q" target="_blank">SBX Kickback Wildcard</a>, either way even tho he's really good, that doesn't change the fact that still he is an underdog and not very known tbf</p>
				
				<h3>Shehab</h3>
				<div class="img-div">
					<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/538643883270209546/c6dd493314c772692ac17942e37beafe.png?size=2048" alt="Shehab el 3rs">
				</div>
				<p>Hwa el m3rs da gy tb3 men?</p>
				<p>nah but for real, mans got an insanely clean throat bass, it is so good that he can create a beat only by using throat bass and you'd still say it was a good one. Also if you went to El Taw7eed W El Noor and bought Improver you'd be surprised that it actually was Shehab that came in the box, you just didn't notice because they both have that duck nature in them</p>
				<p>imo Shehab is the best beatboxer in the world and my reasoning is, can you name me a beatboxer that has covered the one, the only, Reda El Bahrawy? I can. Shehab El-Nasery. Check out his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMUn6cGHcig/">sick routine</a> ely hwa m4 fakr hwa 3mlo azay aslan.</p>

				<p>Now ano mtnak kom w el clean K-Snare kom tany, he built himself a reputation of being the clean K snare guy, but he's also got really good basics and fundamentals in general and he's got a really clean ass chest bass, good inward tech and he knows his shit.</p>

					</div>
					<p>Honestly do I have to talk about Napom? Here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYKMoZnuTJE" target="_blank">Roll like this</a> will speak on his behalf.</p>
					<p>Honestly man's a beast, he helped revolutionize beatbox to the way that it is nowadays, He was also one of the first people who use a lot of liprolls in so many different ways.</p>
					<p>If that didn't convince you, he also won the GBB17 ,the GNB18 and the vokal.total2017 and came vice-champ at the GBB16 and a lot more</p>
					<p>He also released <a href="https://swissbeatbox.com/music/napom_lips/" target="_blank">Lips</a>, a beatboxing album, on all streaming platforms in 2018.</p>
						
					<h3>Inertia</h3>
					<div class="img-div">
						<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vGAC2dPQ2M4/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Inertia staring down your soul">
					</div>
					<p>2 Words. Inward bass.</p>
					<p>I think I can say with confidence that Inertia and Vocodah have the best inward bass, but even though Inertia started to come up lately, he's been around since Teamspeak days</p>
					<p>People started to know about him when he did his shoutout for Swissbeatbox, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcPWiq1ZSDs" target="_blank">Reckless</a>, and his shoutout for Beatbox Television, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv7I2fZxz68">High, Middle, Low</a>.
					<p>He also won the EastCoast7ToSmoke and the GNB19</p>
						
					<p>Other notable American beatboxers include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Villain</li>
						<li>Kenny Urban</li>

					<h3>D-Low</h3>
					<div id="img-div">

					</div>
					<p>Have you ever thought what if there was a beatboxer that had it all? You know, Structure, Musicality, Energy, Bass and Cleanliness? Well that's basically D-Low.</p>
				
				<p>He is one of the GOATs. Literally has the best mix of everything. He can get you hyped up or relaxed and chill, and he will fuck shit up if he's on stage, that's guranteed</p>
				
				<p>Lad's also won the GBB19, the SBXKB21 and won the UK Solo Championships 5 times lmao and came vice-champ GBB18.       </p>
				
				<p>He is the best the UK has to offer, his slogan? yl3n kosmen om B-Art.     </p>
				
				<h3>Reeps One</h3>
				<div class="img-div">
					<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.theglassmagazine.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tom-Reep-Featured-M-1-e1512559160530.jpg?fit=1400%2C900&ssl=1" alt="Just Reeps One Standing">
				</div>
				<p>Reeps One is where the soul of beatbox is at. He was one of the first of the new school wave dating back to 2009, and he definitely helped popularize beatbox and evolve it to make the way that it is.</p>
				<p>He came up with his original technique called 'Inward Drag', He even has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uJw84DTVqk&ab_channel=Swissbeatbox" target="_blank">video</a> on SBX with the same name and that technique is still relevenat nowadays, just more complex. Trung Bao has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRv51HiKwLk">video</a> on the topic.</p>
				
				<p>Reeps is considered one of the few godfathers of beatboxing, and for good reason.</p>

				<div class="img-div">
					<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BuyEzVPXMLc/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Helium with a mic">
				</div>
				<p>Helium is basically a portable drum machine. His drums are cleaner than some free drum kits for FL Studio.</p>
				<p>His style is really linear but still he's mastered his sounds that it's feels different every time you hear him.</p>
				<p>He's also known for making practice beats for different skill levels, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYan16w4Xzk&ab_channel=Helium_Beatbox" target="_blank">this one</a> but good luck trying to follow along.</p>
